Introduction:
Our project involves designing an autonomous robotic car that competes in the Future Engineers category. The vehicle is constructed using LEGO hardware, powered by a modified Arduino-based brain called PBOT, and equipped with an AI camera. The objective is to create a vehicle capable of navigating a track, detecting and avoiding obstacles based on their colors. This description outlines the various modules in our code, their integration with electromechanical components, and the process of building, compiling, and loading the code onto the vehicle's controllers.

Code Modules and their Relationship with Electromechanical Components:
1. PBOT Brain and Power Management:
   The PBOT, acting as the central processing unit, receives inputs from the AI camera and sends commands to control the direction and speed of the vehicle. It is powered by a 3600mAh battery, activated by a toggle switch. The PBOT serves as the brain that processes data and executes commands, ensuring seamless communication between software and hardware.

2. AI Color Recognition Camera:
   The AI camera serves as the "eyes" of the vehicle, identifying colors of obstacles using color recognition. It is configured autonomously through its own software and hardware setup. The camera's software defines the colors to recognize and analyze. Upon identifying an obstacle's color, the camera sends signals to the PBOT brain, prompting specific actions such as turning left or right to avoid obstacles.

3. Direction and Speed Control Motors:
   The robotic car is equipped with a continuous current motor that controls its speed and a servo motor responsible for steering. Both motors are driven by algorithms generated by the AI camera's analysis. The PBOT brain translates these algorithms into precise motor commands, allowing the vehicle to execute the desired movements.

Construction and Code Compilation Process:
1. LEGO Hardware Construction:
   The vehicle is physically built using LEGO components, ensuring structural integrity and modularity. We assemble the chassis, attach motors, and create a sturdy base for mounting the AI camera and PBOT brain. This step involves careful alignment to ensure smooth operation.

2. AI Camera and PBOT Integration:
   The AI camera is securely mounted on the vehicle to capture the surrounding environment. The PBOT brain is connected to the camera and the motors, establishing a communication network between the components. Wiring and connections are organized to avoid interference and ensure reliable operation.

3. Mind+ Programming:
   We utilize the Mind+ software, an Arduino-based platform with a user-friendly interface resembling Scratch 3.0. This simplifies code generation and allows us to visually construct algorithms using drag-and-drop blocks. Each block represents specific functions, making it easier to comprehend and debug the code.

4. Code Compilation and Loading:
   After creating the algorithm in Mind+, we compile the code into a format that the PBOT brain can understand. The compiled code is then loaded onto the PBOT's microcontroller, preparing the vehicle for autonomous operation. We ensure proper code execution through testing and iterative refinement.

Conclusion:
Our autonomous color recognition robotic car exemplifies the integration of hardware and software components. By combining LEGO construction, a modified Arduino brain (PBOT), an AI color recognition camera, and Mind+ programming, we have created a vehicle capable of intelligently navigating a track, detecting obstacle colors, and making informed decisions to avoid collisions. This comprehensive system demonstrates our innovation and expertise in robotics and engineering.
